# HospitalBedsAnalysisOf_IndiaAndUSA

This is a Project of Data Analytics which gives analysis of data of hospital beds in two countries that are India and USA.
As the COVID-19 disease started in early 2020's the requirement of hospital beds increased.
At that time it was required to know the available hostpital beds city wise so
using various function of Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas I analysed the data of hospital beds and using functions of Matplotlib 
visualized the data.

I hope this data helps hospital managements.
